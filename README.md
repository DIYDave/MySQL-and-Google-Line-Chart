## How can I populate Google line chart with data from mySQL database. (single file / Inline solution)

Text:
I have an MCU (ESP8266) with a temperature and humidity sensor. The MCU sends the measurement data via MQTT to an MQTT broker running on my Synology NAS. 
Also running on the NAS is an MQTT client (Node.js) that writes the received data to the MySQL database on the NAS.
Last but not least, a web server and PHP server are also running on the NAS.

I want make a simple website to display the data from the db as a line chart.
